# TODO: Implement Cebu and Bohol Portfolio Features

## Steps to Complete:
- [ ] Add 4 new project items for Cebu in index.html, each with data-category="Cebu" and modal triggers
- [ ] Add 1 new project item for Bohol in index.html with data-category="Bohol" and modal trigger
- [ ] Add modal HTML structures for Cebu (4 separate modals, each with at least 1 image) and Bohol (1 modal with 4 images)
- [ ] Update script.js to handle modal opening and closing functionality
- [ ] Update style.css to style the modals (overlay, close button, etc.)
- [ ] Test filtering: Ensure Cebu shows 4 items, Bohol shows 1 item
- [ ] Test popups: Verify modals open on click and close properly
